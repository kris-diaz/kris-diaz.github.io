    <p>I played Corporate Clash since 2018 and always wanted to assist the team with maintaining and improving the game experience for players. After completing a semester of technical computer courses in high school, I thought it was time to take a chance and put my new found skills to the test. I applied and was accepted into the Corporate Clash Team as a Support Representative on April 25, 2022. Since then, I have been promoted twice, and currently serve as a Team Lead for the Support Team.</p>
