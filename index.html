  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Howdy! My preferred name is Kris, however, you may also call me Christian! I'm an undergraduate student at the University of South Florida studying Physics & Astronomy. I aspire to work in the fields of Cosmology, Stellar Astronomy or Planetary Science, and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to join your research team!

    <hr>
    Some of my personal interests include astrophotography, performing volunteer work and mountain biking. I try to cultivate spaces that are inclusive of people of all walks of life, whether that be in my volunteer work or personal life.
